# Terraform AWS Infrastructure Provisioning

This project uses **Terraform** to provision and manage key AWS resources, including **VPCs**, **Subnets**, **Security Groups**, **EC2 Instances**, and a fully functional **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** cluster. It also supports automatic deployment of **Docker containers** and includes reusable modules to streamline infrastructure management.
